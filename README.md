# Next Semester
This project purpose is to help students from the CS faculty at the Technion to make decisions for their next semester courses.

You can find all the relevant courses and their average grade in the recent years, you may find the prerequisites graph useful for understading which courses you need to take in order to be able to take a spesific course.
